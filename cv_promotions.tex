\subsection{Philosophy of Mathematics}\label{sub:philosophy_of_mathematics} % (fold)

My doctoral dissertation, ``Structure and the Concept of Number'', defended a platonist interpretation of arithmetic against the skeptical arguments of Paul Benacerraf. These arguments have motivated an important and influential alternative to platonism, structuralism. Whereas platonists maintains that arithmetic has as its subject matter facts about a distinguished progression of abstract objects, the natural numbers, the structuralist maintains that arithmetic has as its subject matter general facts about actual and hypothetical progressions. The project was to find a platonist interpretation of arithmetic immune to Benacerraf's criticism and that respected structuralist intuitions. The key to this was to recognizing that structuralism is a \emph{reductive} thesis---there are no facts about arithmetic over and above general facts about progressions. I argued that the structuralist analysis can be read non-reductively, and that the non-reductive, platonist, interpretation is required given certain minimal semantic theses. 

``What Numbers Could Be (And Hence Necessarily Are)'', 1996, argued for the non-reductive reading of the structuralist analysis. It is the only extant platonist interpretation of arithmetic with an explanation for the modal status of the natural nemubers.

``Modal Structuralism and Cardinality'', unpublished, argues that the analysis of cardinality in structuralist terms could not avoid commitment to abstract objects and so is not a genuine alternative to the non-reductive interpretation of that analysis.

``The Transparency of Truth'', 1997, argues that a puzzle about the nature of truth due to Frege is best resolved by a particular class of deflationist views of truth. Deflationism is one of the semantic views underpinning the non-reductive reading of structuralism.

``Reasoning and Representing'', 2001, argues that some version of inferential role semantics must be true of logical discourse. Inferential role semantics for logical discourse was the second semantic view underpinning the non-reductive reading of structuralism.

\subsection{Ethics}\label{sub:ethics} % (fold)

My research in ethics has primarily concerned the nature of moral judgment, and the nature of the norms that govern moral discourse. This is paradigmatically a metaethical concern, but I am keen to argue that these are inseparable from normative considerations.

Orthodoxy recognizes to alternatives to moral realism, the error theory and noncognitivism. In \emph{Moral Fictionalism}, 2005, I argue that that there is a third alternative, moral realism. This has hitherto gone unrecognized due to metaethicists not carefully distinguishing semantic and psychological theses that have usually been held in tandem. The interest in moral fictionalism is not confined to the taxonomic. The fictionalist interpretation of moral practice is a kind of moral skepticism---a moral skepticism that would arise if the norms governing moral judgment permit a kind of intransigence in moral disagreement that is morally objectionable. Moral fictionalism, then, is a dystopian metaphysics, a parable about what moral practice would become if certain objectionable features of current moral practice became endemic. 

Moral fictionalism is now widely recognized an a bona fide alternative to moral realism. The second edition of Alexander Miller's \emph{An Introduction to Contemporary Metaethics}, forthcoming, a standard textbook on metaethics, will include a chapter on moral fictionalism.

Moral fictionalism is not the only form of fictionalism. Fictionalist theses have been advanced in almost every area of serious metaphysical inquiry. To promote this approach I edited \emph{Fictionalism in Metaphysics}, 2005b, the first anthology on this important topic. The anthology has been very successful and has been the basis of graduate seminars in the US and the UK.

``\emph{Moral Fictionalism}, a Summary'' and ``The Trouble with Terminology'', 2008a and 2008b, my contributions to a book symposium on \emph{Moral Fictionalism} and are a precis of the book and replies to my critics, respectively.

``Moral Fictionalism, the Frege-Geach problem, and Reasonable Inference'' is a reply to criticisms of Matti Eklund posed in his Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on fictionalism. Eklund has written a further reply, ``The Frege--Geach Problem and Kalderon's Moral Fictionalism'', forthcoming in \emph{Philosophical Quarterly}.

``Morality: Fact or Fiction'' is a public talk on the moral skepticism and normative concerns about the conduct of public moral discourse that animated \emph{Moral Fictionalism}.

``Open Questions and the Manifest Image'', 2004, is a spin off of material not included in \emph{Moral Fictionalism}. Moore's open question argument is widely regarded as an important foundational argument in metaethics. It is also widely misunderstood, or so I argued.

``Groundwork for a Nonconcessive Expressivism'', unpublished, is a reply to Paul Horwich's version of noncognitivism. 

``Respecting Value'', forthcoming, is a defense of Kant's doctrine's about respect against Joseph Raz's criticisms. It picks up some of the Kantian themes in \emph{Moral Fictionalism} and puts them to non-skeptical use.

\subsection{Color}\label{sub:color} % (fold)

The nature of color and color experience has been a persistent interest since graduate school where I attended seminars on these topics by Mark Johnston and Saul Kripke. I have been keen to defend the view that colors are mind-independent qualities of material objects as they seem, pre-theoretically to be, and that the phenomenology of color experience can be explained in terms of the presentation of these mind-independent qualities in color experience. 

``Color and the Inverted Spectrum'', 2000, co-written David Hilbert, addresses the so-called inverted spectrum argument. The inverted spectrum argument uses actual and hypothetical variation in color perception to establish a claim about the nature of color experience---that there could be a phenomenological difference between color experiences without a difference in what's presented. We criticize then extant versions of the argument and further argue that any version of the argument will fail to account adequately for asymmetries in the phenomenological color space.

Perceptual variation has been deployed not only to establish claims about color experience but also to establish claims about the nature of the colors. The argument from conflict appearances uses perceptual variation to argue against the reality of the colors. Most ways of resisting this argument do so at the cost of denying that the colors are mind-independent. In ``Color Pluralism'', 2007, I argue that the mind-independence of the colors can be retained consistent with veridical perceptual variation if we abandon color monism for a version of color pluralism. According to color pluralism, there are a plurality of families of color properties perceptually available to different kinds of perceivers. (So, for example, bees see a different family of colors than humans.)

``Metamerism, Constancy, and Knowing Which'', forthcoming, is a direct argument that color experience has a presentational phenomenology. I argue that color experience must have a presentational phenomenology given their epistemic role in identifying colors across different circumstances of perception. I also argue that dispositional theories cannot adequately account for color constancy.

``The Multiply Qualitative'' takes up Sydney Shoemaker's criticism of ``Color and the Inverted Spectrum'' in his paper ``Color, Content, and Character''. I argue that the causal intuitions that Shoemaker appeals to fail if experience is conceived to be relational---the natural metaphysics of experience understood as having a presentational phenomenology.

``Color and the Problem of Perceptual Presence'', submitted, is an extension of the material in ``Metamerism, Constancy, and Knowing Which''. Like dispositional theories of color, No√´'s phenomenal objectivism attempts to understand being colored in terms of looking colored. The account is meant to resolve a prima facie conflict in or between experiences in cases of color constancy. I argue that no prima facie conflict is generated and that phenomenal objectivism, like the dispositional theory, fails to provide an adequate account of color constancy.

``Color Illusion'', currently being composed. As standardly conceived, an illusion is an experience of an object \( o \) appearing \( F \) where \( o \) is not in fact \( F \). Paradigm examples of color illusion, however, do not fit this pattern. A diagnosis of this uncovers different sense of appearance talk that is the basis of a dilemma for the standard conception. The dilemma is only a challenge. But if the challenge cannot be met, then any conception of experience, such as representationalism, that is committed to the standard conception is false. I argue that a relational theory of color experience provides a better account of color illusion.

I have applied for a Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship to pursue this research further. I proposed to write a book, ``Regaining Color: From Inverted Spectra to Conflicting Appearances''. Two problems form the intellectual background of the present project---the problem of the manifest and the hard problem of consciousness. 

The first is the special and central case of the problem of the manifest: How can the colors, given their perceived qualitative nature, be materially realized?

The second is a contemporary problem that lacks ancient precedent---the so-called hard problem of consciousness. Whereas the problem of the manifest is a problem in metaphysics, the hard problem of consciousness is a problem in the philosophy of mind: How can experience, given its qualitative character, be materially realized? And just as the fundamental problem in the metaphysics of color is a special case of the problem of the manifest, a problem about color experience is a special case of the hard problem of consciousness: How can color experience, given its qualitative character, be materially realized?

So formulated, these problems are structurally parallel. This may be no accident. Indeed, I believe that there is an explanation for this. Consider one way of responding to the problem of the manifest as it arises for the colors. The metaphysical problem only arises if the qualitative nature of the colors is part of what is present in color experience. But, suppose, instead, that the qualitative character is not a matter of \emph{what} is present in color experience but \emph{how} the colors are presented in experience. So understood, the problematic qualitative character is, strictly speaking, not a feature of the colors (and, hence, no obstacle to their material instantiation) but a feature of color experience. However, such a reply immediately faces the hard problem of consciousness, for if we conceive of the mind as part of nature, we now have the problem of how color experience, given its qualitative character, might be materially realized. It can seem that we have only pushed the problem back a level.

Supppose, however, we could successfully defend the idea that the qualitative character of color experience is best explained by what's present in color experience. Then the hard problem of consciousness as it arises with respect to color experience has \emph{dissolved} into the metaphysics of color. Indeed, the hard problem of consciousness rests on a kind of \emph{introjective error}---it arises from systematically misattributing mind-independent qualities of material things to mental things. In wondering how the experience of red, given its qualitative character, could be materially realized by the visual system of the perceiver, one attributes to something mental, the conscious experience of red, the qualitative nature of a mind-independent color.
