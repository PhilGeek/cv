The nature of color and color experience has been a persistent interest since graduate school where I attended seminars on these topics by Mark Johnston and Saul Kripke. I have been keen to defend the view that colors are mind-independent qualities of material objects as they seem, pre-theoretically to be, and that the phenomenology of color experience can be explained in terms of the presentation of these mind-independent qualities in color experience. 

``Color and the Inverted Spectrum'', 2000, co-written David Hilbert, addresses the so-called inverted spectrum argument. The inverted spectrum argument uses actual and hypothetical variation in color perception to establish a claim about the nature of color experience---that there could be a phenomenological difference between color experiences without a difference in what's presented. We criticize then extant versions of the argument and further argue that any version of the argument will fail to account adequately for asymmetries in the phenomenological color space.

Perceptual variation has been deployed not only to establish claims about color experience but also to establish claims about the nature of the colors. The argument from conflict appearances uses perceptual variation to argue against the reality of the colors. Most ways of resisting this argument do so at the cost of denying that the colors are mind-independent. In ``Color Pluralism'', 2007, I argue that the mind-independence of the colors can be retained consistent with veridical perceptual variation if we abandon color monism for a version of color pluralism. According to color pluralism, there are a plurality of families of color properties perceptually available to different kinds of perceivers. (So, for example, bees see a different family of colors than humans.)

``Metamerism, Constancy, and Knowing Which'', forthcoming, is a direct argument that color experience has a presentational phenomenology. I argue that color experience must have a presentational phenomenology given their epistemic role in identifying colors across different circumstances of perception. I also argue that dispositional theories cannot adequately account for color constancy.

``The Multiply Qualitative'' takes up Sydney Shoemaker's criticism of ``Color and the Inverted Spectrum'' in his paper ``Color, Content, and Character''. I argue that the causal intuitions that Shoemaker appeals to fail if experience is conceived to be relational---the natural metaphysics of experience understood as having a presentational phenomenology.

``Color and the Problem of Perceptual Presence'', submitted, is an extension of the material in ``Metamerism, Constancy, and Knowing Which''. Like dispositional theories of color, No√´'s phenomenal objectivism attempts to understand being colored in terms of looking colored. The account is meant to resolve a prima facie conflict in or between experiences in cases of color constancy. I argue that no prima facie conflict is generated and that phenomenal objectivism, like the dispositional theory, fails to provide an adequate account of color constancy.

``Color Illusion'', currently being composed. As standardly conceived, an illusion is an experience of an object \( o \) appearing \( F \) where \( o \) is not in fact \( F \). Paradigm examples of color illusion, however, do not fit this pattern. A diagnosis of this uncovers different sense of appearance talk that is the basis of a dilemma for the standard conception. The dilemma is only a challenge. But if the challenge cannot be met, then any conception of experience, such as representationalism, that is committed to the standard conception is false. I argue that a relational theory of color experience provides a better account of color illusion.

I have applied for a Leverhulme Major Research Fellowship to pursue this research further. I proposed to write a book, ``Regaining Color: From Inverted Spectra to Conflicting Appearances''. Two problems form the intellectual background of the present project---the problem of the manifest and the hard problem of consciousness. 

The first is the special and central case of the problem of the manifest: How can the colors, given their perceived qualitative nature, be materially realized?

The second is a contemporary problem that lacks ancient precedent---the so-called hard problem of consciousness. Whereas the problem of the manifest is a problem in metaphysics, the hard problem of consciousness is a problem in the philosophy of mind: How can experience, given its qualitative character, be materially realized? And just as the fundamental problem in the metaphysics of color is a special case of the problem of the manifest, a problem about color experience is a special case of the hard problem of consciousness: How can color experience, given its qualitative character, be materially realized?

So formulated, these problems are structurally parallel. This may be no accident. Indeed, I believe that there is an explanation for this. Consider one way of responding to the problem of the manifest as it arises for the colors. The metaphysical problem only arises if the qualitative nature of the colors is part of what is present in color experience. But, suppose, instead, that the qualitative character is not a matter of \emph{what} is present in color experience but \emph{how} the colors are presented in experience. So understood, the problematic qualitative character is, strictly speaking, not a feature of the colors (and, hence, no obstacle to their material instantiation) but a feature of color experience. However, such a reply immediately faces the hard problem of consciousness, for if we conceive of the mind as part of nature, we now have the problem of how color experience, given its qualitative character, might be materially realized. It can seem that we have only pushed the problem back a level.

Supppose, however, we could successfully defend the idea that the qualitative character of color experience is best explained by what's present in color experience. Then the hard problem of consciousness as it arises with respect to color experience has \emph{dissolved} into the metaphysics of color. Indeed, the hard problem of consciousness rests on a kind of \emph{introjective error}---it arises from systematically misattributing mind-independent qualities of material things to mental things. In wondering how the experience of red, given its qualitative character, could be materially realized by the visual system of the perceiver, one attributes to something mental, the conscious experience of red, the qualitative nature of a mind-independent color.
